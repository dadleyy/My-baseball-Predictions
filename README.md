2012 Baseball Predictions
=======================
A data viz application for viewing the past 6 years of baseball stats with predictions for 2012. 

##About##

After a few of us had watched the movie *moneyball* with Brad Pitt, our team at [involution studios](http://goinvo.com) was interested to see if the moview had any real grounding to it. We also wanted to create a fun way to experiment with the data we collected, and show off our ability to present data. 

This project takes advantage of loading in a CSV file, which is loaded into the page during a `d3.csv()` call. If you'd like to check out that file for yourself, you will see a reference to it in the source code.
