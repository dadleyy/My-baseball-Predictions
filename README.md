My-baseball-Predictions
=======================
A data viz application for viewing the past 6 years of baseball stats with predictions for 2012. 

##About##

After a few of us had watched the movie *moneyball* with Brad Pitt, our team at [involution studios](http://goinvo.com) was interested to see if the moview had any real grounding to it. We also wanted to create a fun way to experiment with the data we collected, and show off our ability to present data.
